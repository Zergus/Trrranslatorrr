# Trrranslatorrr

# Description:

This is simple sync-translating bot. Core based on [telegram-node-bot](https://github.com/naltox/telegram-node-bot).

Self-enabling once `app.js` is running.

Make sure to use `conf.json_sample` for creating real `conf.json`.


# Usage in Telegram:

`/trtrack @user` - every message of @user will be translated after he typed anything longer then 3 symb.

`/truntrack @user` - stops synco-translating of @user.

`/trhelp` for more commands.
